# Serverless Web Application on AWS

## Project Name: Serverless View Counter Application

### Project Description

This project is a **serverless web application** built using **AWS Lambda (Node.js 22.x)**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, and **CloudFront**. The application displays a greeting form and dynamically updates the **view count** stored in DynamoDB every time the page is visited.

### Key Implementation Steps

âœ… Created a DynamoDB table to store view counts  
âœ… Built a Lambda function (Node.js) to handle **update and fetch operations** for view count  
âœ… Hosted static files (HTML, CSS, JS) on an **S3 bucket with public hosting**  
âœ… Configured **CloudFront distribution** for secure and low latency delivery  
âœ… Implemented **CORS headers** in Lambda to allow cross-origin requests from CloudFront

### Expected Outcome

âœ” **Working serverless web application** accessible globally via CloudFront  
âœ” **View counter updates dynamically** every time the site is visited  
âœ” Hands-on experience in:

- AWS Lambda Function URLs and CORS configuration  
- DynamoDB integration with Lambda (Node.js SDK v3)  
- Hosting static websites on S3 with CloudFront  
- End-to-end deployment of serverless architecture

### Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda (Node.js 22.x)**
- **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Amazon S3**
- **Amazon CloudFront**
- **JavaScript (Fetch API)**

### Further Improvements

ðŸ”œ Potential future additions:

- API Gateway integration for RESTful expansion  
- Authentication with Cognito for user-specific data  
- Terraform or AWS SAM for infrastructure as code deployment
